Elevator Pitch:My capstone is on arcade stick hardware. I played alot on arcade cabinets as a kid and still do now thanks with barcades. When at home I use arcade sticks on new systems. I like to share this information for those who don't know and want to know how to get things started and what's the different style of hardware. I'm using java.html,and css.

User Flow: User may click on link to navigate to and from the site pages. They will have 3 pages to choose from.


Font: "Shadows Into Light" and "Acme"(google fonts)

Colors:Darker background(easier on the eyes) with Red and Blue color text.
