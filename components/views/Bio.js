<p>The most common type of stick you will run into when playing at a barcade. It's sturdy built base,concave buttons,and the stick is bat top. 
<p>If you're trying to get an american arcade stick you will most likely have to create your own. If you play Mortal Kombat,NBA JAM, and NFL Blitz.This is my perfered style to play personally. </p>

<p>Happ makes the most parts for this style. They make the highest quailty parts.</p>
