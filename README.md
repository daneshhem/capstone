# A site deadicated to differences between American,Japan,and Korean arcade sticks.

My capstone is on arcade stick hardware. I played alot on arcade cabinets as a kid and still do now thanks with barcades. When at home I use arcade sticks on new systems. I like to share this information for those who don't know and want to know how to get things started and what's the different style of hardware. I'm using java.html,and css.
